		<div><h1>Our Mission</h1></div>
		<div><h2>"To provide a private, versatile and easy way for people to manage their lifetime of memories.</h2></div>
		<div>
			<p>
				We've all been told that the world is changing. Facebook and other social 
				networking sites say privacy is a thing of the past, and that you should just get used to it.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				At Photolude we have asked the question "Why?". Privacy isn't a dirty word, but a statement 
				which says "My memories belong to me".
