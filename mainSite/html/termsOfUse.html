			<p>This is an agreement between Photolude (referred to as "the company") and you (referred to as "the member"). This document ensures protection of both parties and ensures that the company discloses the limits of liability which will be taken on.</p>
	
			<p>The company will provide storage as for the member's usage. The company will take on measures to ensure that the member's photos are not lost due to hardware malfunction or corruption. These measures include photo backup and redundancy across network resources and physical backups (taken on a monthly basis). In the event that a backup resource is destroyed, the company is obligated to replace the resource to ensure that the member is protected. Although it is the company's highest priority to protect and ensure your data is always available to the member, in the event that all backup sources are destroyed, either in an act of god or an unforeseen failure, the company is not liable for lost data.</p>
	
			<p>The company will make appropriate efforts to provide 24 hour access to your photos, but does not guarantee it. In the event that the company has a planned downtime, the company will inform the member via email as to this downtime a week prior to the downtime. In the event of a cyber-attack, the company will take action to ensure the member's security, which may include cutting access to members in order to fix security threats. The company will provide appropriate deterrents to ensure the member's privacy but is not liable for that privacy.</p>
	
			<p>The member is responsible for following all United States laws. Photos or pictures which break the United States laws or depict the law being broken are all to be considered violations of the user license agreement. The company will not be responsible for ensuring the member use is in compliance, but the company retains the right to investigate any complaint that the member has violated the law. In the event that the law has been broken, or a photo depicts the law being broken, the company will work with law enforcement if requested.</p>
